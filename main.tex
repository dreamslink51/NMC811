\begin{abstract}
The first generation of cathodes in commercial lithium-ion batteries are based on layered transition metal oxides. Research on ternary compounds, such as LiCoO$_2$, evolved into mixed-metal systems, notably Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O$_2$ (NMC), which allows significant tuning of the physical properties. Despite its widespread application in commercial devices, the fundamental understanding of NMC is limited. Here, we review the latest insights from multiscale modelling, bridging between the redox phenomena that occur at an atomistic level to the transport of ions and electrons across an operating device. We discuss changes in the electronic and vibrational structure through the NMC compositional space and how these link to continuum models of electrochemical charge/discharge cycling. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges for predictive models of high-performance batteries, including capturing the relevant device bottlenecks and chemical degradation processes, such as oxygen evolution.

%\section{Introduction (all)}
% Rechargeable batteries – Li batteries, current uses, need to improve.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were developed by Whittingham in the 1970s \cite{whittingham1974hydrated,whittingham1976electrical} but did not become a promising technology until 1979, when Goodenough and Mizushima successfully demonstrated \ce{LiCoO2} as a cathode.\cite{mizushima1980lixcoo2} 
These were successfully commercialized by Sony in 1991 and have since become instrumental in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage applications.\cite{armand2008building,scrosati2011lithium,goodenough2013li,etacheri2011challenges,he2012layered,rozier2015li,dunn2011electrical} 
However, to fully electrify the transport and energy sectors, further advancements in LIBs are required to achieve higher energy densities, better longevity, and lower cost, from sustainable materials. 
The performance of a battery is highly dependent on the choice of cathode material and the transition metals they are composed of.\cite{Sari2019,Julien2014,whittingham2008materials,bruce2012li}

% Introduce Cathode – limiting factor, composite materials (NMC).
\ce{LiCoO2} offered a number of attractive features, including ease of synthesis, reversible lithium insertion, high specific energy density, and high thermal stability.\cite{gibbard1989high,plichta1989improved,noh2013comparison} 
However, its application was limited due to capacity fade and the cost/geopolitical issues of cobalt mining, which made large scale energy storage solutions impractical. \cite{mo_impact_2018,Banza2009}. 
Other oxide materials, such as \ce{LiNiO2} and Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ were considered, each with their own challenges, such as the longevity and safety of \ce{LiNiO2}\cite{min_comparative_2016} and Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ showing irreversible structural changes, due to Jahn-Teller effects and low capacity.\cite{tian_performance_2018} Partial replacement of Co in \ce{LiCoO2} with Ni and Mn was considered, resulting in the layered oxide Li[Ni$_x$Mn$_y$Co$_z$]O$_2$, where $x+y+z=1$, commonly termed NMC, with subsequent numbers relating to the ratio of the transition metals.\cite{paulsen2000o2,paulsen20002, lu2001layered,rozier2015li} 
These NMC materials were able to achieve a more balanced performance, preserving favourable voltage characteristics, reaching a higher capacity (\SI{200}{mAh.g^{-1}}), and addressing cost and abundance issues. \cite{sun_electronic_2017,larcher2015towards,ohzuku2001layered} 
NMC also demonstrates improved electrochemical performance, enhanced rate capability \cite{noh2013comparison,dahn1991rechargeable}, and better cycle life/thermal stability \cite{kim2006synthesis,armstrong1996synthesis}.

%Going to Ni rich and NMC811
The tuning of the transition metal compositions of NMC has been a focus of research, in an effort to optimise desirable battery properties including capacity, cyclic rate, electrochemical stability, and lifetime, whilst also reducing cost.\cite{duan2019insights}
Many NMC compositions are already in use, with commercial applications shifting from NMC111 to higher Ni compositions, including NMC811 (Li[Ni$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$]O$_2$).\cite{zhang2018structural}
Current investigations are now focused towards further reducing the Co content and optimising NMC811, to improve the performance of current and future generation batteries for long-range electric vehicles\cite{azevedo2018mining} and for use in all-solid-state LIBs.\cite{myung2017nickel,ohzuku_layered_2001,lu2001layered,belharouak2003li,kim2014unexpected,sun_electronic_2017}

%Challenges for NMC811 
Despite the improved properties of NMC811, the composition still exhibits rapid voltage and capacity fading, as well as poor structural and thermal stability,\cite{noh2013comparison,Li-aenm-2019,Jerng-ACS-AMI-2020} leading to severe degradation.\cite{Zhang-acs.chemmater-2019,Feng-2019,Xia2018,De-AdMat-2019,Li_Nat-Comm-2017,Manthiram-NatComm-2020}
Degradation can occur through a range of physical and chemical processes, resulting in loss of lithium inventory (LLI), loss of active material (LAM), and/or impedance increase.\cite{vetter2005ageing} 
Attempts have been made to circumvent these degradation processes using approaches including surface coating, doping with ions, and electrolyte modification;\cite{maleki2019controllable,Liu-JSSE-2020} however, current experimental probes are limited in the detail they can provide. 
Additional challenges lie in improving safety and prolonging the life of batteries, requiring optimal thermal and operational management. 
These are areas where computational modelling can provide insight and direction.

%Modelling techniques
Atomistic techniques, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), and continuum techniques, including the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model and its simplification, the single particle model (SPM),\cite{Newman1975porous,Doyle1993DFN} broadly describe battery modelling techniques from the atomic to cell level.\cite{Howey_2020} 
DFT is well suited for investigating electronic structure, whereas MD, either \textit{ab initio} or classical, can be used to provide vital information on system dynamics.
These atomistic models can provide insights into material properties, but can be limited by scale. 
Continuum modelling, a larger scale computational technique, is better placed to provide cell level properties.
The DFN model assumes the electrodes are comprised of a homogeneous matrix of spherical particles and is able to predict the dynamics and internal states of a battery, for example, Li concentration within active materials.
The SPM is a further simplification that considers one representative particle.
Combining atomistic and continuum model predictions within a multiscale modelling framework can provide a more detailed understanding of the charge and mass transport processes, resulting in more accurate predictions of battery behaviour.

% review outline -  Motivation and what our review is about.
In this perspective, drawing from our experience as part of the multiscale modelling project of the Faraday Institution, we highlight the importance of modelling NMC across length and time scales.
We also provide an outlook to current and future challenges faced in the modelling of multicomponent cathode materials.

\section*{Electrons: Oxidation State Competition}
The practical use of Ni-rich NMC materials in LIBs faces various challenges, including structural degradation and capacity fading. 
The redox reactions and consequent reversible capacity of NMC are primarily influenced by the cation ordering and spin interaction of active elements in the transition metal layers.\cite{Li-acsami-2020,Maleki-aenm.2019,Feng-2019, Xia2018, Xiao_NanoEner2018} 
Different compositions and charge distributions result in the appearance of various valence states, e.g. Ni$^{2+}$, Ni$^{3+}$, Ni$^{4+}$, Co$^{3+}$, Co$^{4+}$, Mn$^{4+}$.\cite{Xiao_NanoEner2018} 
The coexistence and interactions of these multivalent transition metal charges and spins make it difficult to determine a unique ground state for NMCs.\cite{Xiao_NanoEner2018}
Understanding the range of transition metal oxidation states, and the roles they play in degradation processes, is therefore crucial for improving these promising cathode materials.

Ni is a key redox active element in NMC.
Experimentally, Ni in NMC811 is present as a mixture of Ni$^{2+}$ (with ground-state electronic configuration of ${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{2}$) and Ni$^{3+}$ (${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{1}$) oxidation states, with an average value close to 3+.\cite{Zhu_JMatChemA2019,Katharina-chemmater,Kondrakov_JPhysChemC2017}
During charging-discharging cycling, the Ni$^{2+}$ can migrate from the Ni plane to the Li plane, creating a Li/Ni disorder.\cite{Zhang-acs.chemmater-2019, Feng-2019, Xia2018} 
This leads to a structural transformation (layered to defect spinel/disordered rock-salt transition) and blocks the Li$^{+}$  migration channels.\cite{Xia2018}
This is thought to be the origin of cracking and subsequent performance degradation upon lithium extraction.\cite{Katharina-chemmater,Li-aenm-2019,Li-EER-2020}   
The dissolution of NMC, resulting in capacity attenuation, can occur due to metal disproportionation.\cite{buchberger2015} 
Ni disproportionation in pristine NMC811 has not been reported experimentally; however, $2$Ni$^{3+}\rightarrow$Ni$^{2+} + $Ni$^{4+}$ has been discussed for LiNiO$_2$ on the basis of calculations.\cite{HChen_PhysRevB2011} 
Charge disproportionation is observed in other cathode materials, such as pristine LiMn$_2$O$_4$, where $2$Mn$^{3+}\rightarrow$Mn$^{2+} + $Mn$^{4+}$ disproportionation is considered to be the main cause of Mn dissolution. 
Understanding active metal disproportionation is important as it poses a threat of poisoning the anode\cite{Parmar-LMO-2020,PASQUALINI2017} and forming inorganic layers in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers,\cite{joshi2014} which, in turn, lead to capacity fade. 

The complex ordering and multivalent nature of transition metals poses significant challenges for modelling. Previous theoretical investigations have studied the influence of oxidation states on various properties of NMC materials.\cite{Dan-Thomas-chemmater,Sun_JPhysChemC2017,Dixit_JPhysChemC2017,Hoang_ACSChemMater2016,Dixit_JElecSoc2017,susai2019improving}
These studies, employing a DFT+\textit{U} approach to treat the high correlation of 3D orbitals, have calculated Jahn-Teller distortion effects, atomic magnetic moments, and density of states for the elucidation of metal oxidation states. 
Ni$^{2+}$ is predominant over Ni$^{3+}$ in NMC333, NMC442, and NMC532, whereas with the increase of Ni content, the occupation of Ni$^{3+}$ steadily increases at the cost of Ni$^{2+}$. 
In NMC811, the Ni$^{3+}$ fraction is reported between 58~\%\cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017} and 62.5~\%.\cite{susai2019improving}
Around 10~\% of Ni as Ni$^{4+}$ is also observed.\cite{susai2019improving} 
The presence of Ni$^{4+}$ is influenced by doping and lithiation state, with Ni$^{4+}$ concentration increasing rapidly in Ni-rich NMC materials as a function of Li content.\cite{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017,susai2019improving} 
\citeauthor{Sun_JPhysChemC2017}\cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017} have reported the existence of Co$^{2+}$ ions along with Co$^{3+}$ ions in pristine NMCs, an observation which was opposed by \citeauthor{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017}.\cite{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017}
Based on magnetic moments and PDOS calculations, \citeauthor{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017} determined that Co remains as Co$^{3+}$ in different pristine NMCs.\cite{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017}
Mn$^{4+}$ remains in close proximity to Ni$^{2+}$, influencing the super-exchange interactions among transition metals.\cite{zheng2019}
In NMC materials with mixed valence states of Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$, Ni$^{3+}$ has the priority to exchange with Li, and changes to a Ni$^{2+}$ state with a spin-flip, to form strong linear Ni$^{2+}$–O2–– Ni$^{2+}$/Mn$^{4+}$ super-exchange networks.\cite{zheng2019,Zheng-acs.jpclett-2017}
This acts as the driving force in tuning the Ni/Li disordering.

%In order to get a deeper insight into the oxidation states in Ni rich NMC811 (LiNi$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$O$_{2}$), hybrid DFT calculations, coupled with magnetic moment analysis are performed in the present study. 
The transition metal arrangement in NMC811 is currently unclear, with some studies suggesting preferred environments and arrangement for the different species and oxidation states.\cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017,zheng2019,zheng2019,Zheng-acs.jpclett-2017}
To determine whether transition metal ordering occurs, 50 NMC811 models were generated by randomly varying the atomic positions of Ni, Mn, and Co in the structure and the energies calculated for the system using hybrid DFT.
Of these 50 models, the lowest system energies were observed for structures with a preference for metal ordering, Figure~\ref{fig:stability}.
This is in contrast to previous suggestions for a homogeneous distribution.\cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017}
Here, Mn$^{4+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ lie in adjacent sites along the shortest crystal axis.
They form continuous linear chains of alternating Mn$^{4+}$-Ni$^{2+}$.
Such ordering is consistent with local charge balance, as previously suggested by \citeauthor{Zeng_ChemMater2007}.\cite{Zeng_ChemMater2007} 
In a number of the low energy configurations, the presence of Ni$^{4+}$ is also observed as previously predicted in the fully lithiated material.\cite{susai2019improving}
However, the difference in energy between all 50 models is less than \SI{6}{meV} per formula unit, and therefore will likely result in a random arrangement under synthesis conditions.
%Figure~\ref{fig:stability}(a) presents the proportion of Ni ions in a given oxidation state for all models, ordered by relative energies per formula unit.
%The analysis of the \% of Ni shows a mixture of Ni states.
The reported average value of a Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation state in NMC811,\cite{Zhu_JMatChemA2019,Katharina-chemmater, Kondrakov_JPhysChemC2017} could be rationalised by a simple distribution \{1 Ni$^{2+}$;7 Ni$^{3+}$;1 Mn$^{4+}$; 1 Co$^{3+}$\} oxidation state model. 
The two lowest energy structures of the 50 models account for this oxidation state distribution.

\section*{Ions: Models of Diffusion}
Understanding ion diffusion is crucial for the development of batteries with high power density, especially in solid electrodes, presenting slow ion diffusion compared to electrolytes. 
The rate of diffusion can be understood through the diffusion coefficient, $D$. 
DFT is well suited to investigate electronic properties and local hopping mechanisms;\cite{van_der_ven_layered_2001, van_der_ven_LiTiS2_2008} however, when it comes to long range diffusion, classical MD is better suited, covering longer time and length scales. 
Here, the chemical bonding is described using interatomic potentials. 
There are many forms of interatomic potentials, with the ability to describe heteropolar solids, such as NMC. 
The most widely used form for investigating diffusion properties is the Coulomb-Buckingham potential.\cite{buckingham_classical_1938} 
This is derived from the Born model\cite{born_1932, mayer_1932}, where the potential energy of the system is expressed as:
%
\begin{equation}
    E(r_{ij}) =  \sum_{ij} \frac{Q_i Q_j}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_{ij}} + \sum_{ij} A \ exp(\frac{-r_{ij}}{\rho}) - Cr_{ij}^{-6}
\end{equation}
%
Here, $i$ and $j$ are ions of charge $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ at a distance of $r_{ij}$, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. In the second term, $A$, $\rho$, and $C$ are the parameters associated with the Buckingham potential.

The sole classical MD study reported for NMC111 employed core-shell Buckingham potentials.\cite{Lee_and_Park_2012}
Using these potentials proved not to be transferable to other NMC compositions. 
Indeed, a catastrophic structural collapse is observed upon removing Li (Figure~\ref{fig:structure_collapse}). 
Delithiation results in the formation of mixed Ni oxidation states and charge disproportion, as discussed previously, which is challenging to represent in a classical model.\cite{Nakamura_2019,Kim_2002,Alonso_1999} 
The complex nature of Ni chemistry extends to the LiNiO$_2$ ternary system. To the best of our knowledge, no interatomic potentials exist for Ni$^{3+}$, evidenced by a lack of classical MD publications for LiNiO$_2$ and NMC systems.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

The development of interatomic potentials, which requires model parameterization with respect to a set of target observables, is a difficult task for systems of such complexity.  
For layered structures, variations of the Buckingham potential form have been developed, some using rigid ion models,\cite{Lewis_1985,Ledwaba2020,Sayle2005,Dawson2014} and others using core-shell models,\cite{Hart1998,Fisher2010,Lewis_1985,Ammundsen1999,Kerisit2014,He2019,lee2012atomistic} with a mixture of formal and partial charges.
Attempts were made to apply the fitting routines from established codes, including the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP),\cite{gale_gulp_1997} Atomicrex,\cite{Stukowski_2017} dftfit,\cite{dftfit} and potfit.\cite{wen_kim-compliant_2017} 
Each code possesses unique functionality, however, none were able to produce robust potentials for NMC or LiNiO$_2$.
POtential Parameter Optimisation for Force-Fields (PopOff),\cite{Morgan2020PopOff} has been specifically developed within the Faraday Institution for fitting different permutations of the Buckingham potential. Its modular design allows flexible fitting of both rigid ion and core-shell models, as well as formal and partial charges. Here, we discuss important aspects of fitting cathode potentials using this code.

In systems such as NMC and LiNiO$_2$, the short-range interactions are overwhelmed by the longer-range Coulombic term.
In these cases, the system charges need to be scaled down to increase the influence of the short-range interactions, termed as partial charges.
A scaling factor of 60 \% formal charge is commonly used,\cite{pedone2006potentials} however, partial charges are system dependent. 
Figure \ref{fig:LiNiO2_fitting} (a) shows $\chi^2$ (fit error) for a fitted Buckingham potential for LiNiO$_2$ reducing with the charge scaling factor, until approximately 60 \% of the formal charge, where it starts to plateau.
This is in broad agreement with literature, with a slightly improved fit at $\sim$50 \% formal charge.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.46]{Figures/LiNiO2_plots.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:LiNiO2_fitting} (a) Plot of the fit error, $\chi^2$, of LiNiO$_2$ as a function of the charge scaling factor, dQ, and (b) Plot of the mean squared displacement of Li in LiNiO$_2$ with 10 \% Li vacancies at 700 K. As this is a layered material, it is expected that no movement will occur in the c direction, only in a and b.}
\end{figure}

Core-shell models introduce polarizability into classical MD simulations. The adiabatic shell model\cite{Mitchell_1993} has been widely used for calculating long trajectories. 
A fraction of the atomic mass is assigned to the shell and there is no explicitly defined fraction size; however, placing 10 \% of the atomic mass on the shell is commonly adopted.\cite{PLIMPTON19951,todorov2006dl_poly_3}

Fitting rigid ion potentials for \ce{LiNiO2} with partial charges resulted in a fit error of $\chi^2$ = 1.665.
By introducing a core-shell potential on the oxygen, with Li and Ni remaining rigid ion, $\chi^2$ was reduced to 0.372. 
This presents evidence that a core-shell potential is required to more accurately reproduce the forces and physics of the system.
In the case of the oxygen core-shell, the spring constant was determined to be 15.443 eV $\cdot$\AA$^{-2}$, with a charge of -1.48 e on the shell and 0.520 e on the core.
Here, the best fit (lowest $\chi^2$) was a core-shell model on the oxygen in a partial charged system. The resulting potential was used with a 10 \% delithiated LiNiO$_2$ supercell at 700 K to conduct MD studies on the diffusion within the material.
The mean squared displacement, Figure \ref{fig:LiNiO2_fitting} (b), represents small movements of Li, however, the resulting self-diffusion coefficient, 6.664$\times 10^{-8}$  cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$, is within the measured range.\cite{Nakamura2000,bruce1992vacancy}
These results indicate that core-shell and partial charges are necessary to include in interatomic potential models for these systems.

This highlights the careful consideration needed when fitting interatomic potentials for heteropolar solids, such as NMC.
Fitting parameters also need to be tailored to the type of study being conducted.
For example, if the potentials for a cathode material were fitted only to lattice parameters, elastic constants, and the bulk modulus, then the potential would not be accurately representative of the cathode redox properties. 
If properties such as the dielectric constant were included, then redox chemistry would be better represented.
Other features such as charge equilibrium and ligand field effects should also be considered. 
Fitting to every material property is not feasible, however, fitting to a broad range of the most relevant properties to the study is needed. 
Tools are currently in development to make fitting interatomic potentials more accessible to atomistic modellers.\cite{gale_empirical_1996,Stukowski_2017,wen_kim-compliant_2017,Morgan2020PopOff}

\section*{Phonons: Thermal Transport}
A traditional image of crystals is that of atoms being held in static positions through stiff chemical bonds. 
In reality, atoms are constantly vibrating around their average crystallographic positions in even the hardest of crystals. 
Lattice dynamics, based on calculation of the interatomic force constants in a crystal, is a powerful tool to model thermal effects, from heat capacity to thermal expansion.
Recently, the description of anharmonic effects including vibrational lifetimes and thermal conductivity has become possible.

There have been a number of studies on the thermal properties of NMC. 
Recently, \citeauthor{yang2020chemical} reported the harmonic phonon dispersion for the \ce{LiMO2} (M = Ni, Co, Mn) endpoints in the NMC oxide system. \cite{yang2020chemical}
Their results reveal that the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect is more pronounced in the crystalline \ce{LiMnO2}, with three distinct bond lengths for the transition metal-O bonds. They found that the medium and low frequency modes are mainly due to motion of Li and transition metals, while the high frequency modes ($>$ 14 THz) are vibrations involving the transition metal and O atoms.
The phonons also provide information of a group, theoretical analysis within the group assigns the irreducible representations of the acoustic and optic branches. Of these, some modes are infra-red (IR) active or Raman active, which is comparable with experimental IR/Raman spectra, with differences likely due to the volume expansion at finite temperature. \cite{yang2019highly} 
For NMC alloy systems, \citeauthor{sun_electronic_2017} showed that the longitudinal acoustic mode frequency increases from NMC333 to NMC811 (Figure \ref{figure_phonon}), due to the weaker electron screening.\cite{sun_electronic_2017}

Both the electrochemical and thermal properties of Li(Ni$_x$Mn$_y$Co$_z$)O$_2$ are dependent on its composition. 
An increase of the Ni content results in an increase in speciﬁc discharge capacity and total residual lithium content, however, the corresponding capacity retention and safety characteristics gradually decreased, as shown in Figure~\ref{figure_thermal}a.\cite{noh2013comparison} 
Increasing Ni/Mn content leads to lattice thermal conductivity suppression.\cite{yang2020chemical}
Thermal conductivity decays exponentially with increasing temperature, due to enhanced phonon scattering, resulting from the larger thermal population of phonon modes.
Figure~\ref{figure_thermal} b shows that, at room temperature, NMC811 has the lowest predicted thermal conductivity of \SI{9.3}{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}, while NMC622 and NMC111 are higher at 13.3 and \SI{17.9}{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}, respectively.
In most devices, the thermal conductivity is much lower than these theoretical upper limits.\cite{takahata2002thermal,chen2006thermal}
Both charging (delithiation) and having smaller grain sizes in polycrystalline cathode materials softens the lattice, leading to smaller phonon velocities and stronger phonon scattering.\cite{feng2020quantum,xia2020high}
These studies show the accessibility of tuning cathode material properties systematically by optimizing the ratio of the transition metals in NMC alloys, overcoming some of the challenges in battery cathode design.

\section*{Cells: Operation and Degradation}
Atomistic modelling is ideal for investigating bulk and localised behaviour, however, these predictions do not provide macroscopic information on material behaviour at the cell level. 
Here, continuum models are well suited to provide further detail. 
These are governed by mathematical expressions that relate concentrations and potentials (partial differential equations). 
Values describing different properties, such as diffusion coefficients and equilibrium potentials are required as inputs or parameters.

The DFN model requires over 25 parameters, with the exact number being dependent on how the equations are expressed.\cite{Kim2011} 
Parameter estimation can be used to simplify the process. 
The approach requires only voltage and current measurements of the battery to evaluate parameters, removing the need for a cell teardown, i.e. dismantling the cell to extract the components for extensive characterisation.\cite{Jin2018} 
However, this is complicated by the large number of parameters that have to be fitted.
The computational expense currently precludes the use of this model in battery management systems and equivalent circuit models are favoured instead, due to their simplicity.\cite{Marquis2019} 
However, the DFN model has been used extensively in battery material development as it provides detailed physical insights compared to other model classes.\cite{Dawson2018}

Recent interest in Ni-rich cathodes has seen the DFN model used extensively to understand the use of graded electrodes (containing multiple electrode particle sizes), to deconvolute capacity and power fade predictions, and to investigate the efficacy of tab and electrode designs for fast charging.\cite{Richardson2020,Kindermann2017,Sturm2019} 
This research has been dependent on parameter sets for NMC materials being reported, however, these values may not reliably describe the properties of Ni-rich NMC, because studies often use parameters determined for cathodes with lower/unknown Ni content. 
For example, \citeauthor{Richardson2020} modelled an NMC material, using the properties of LiNi$_{0.4}$Co$_{0.6}$O$_2$, directly measured by \citeauthor{Ecker2015}\cite{Richardson2020,Ecker2015} \citeauthor{Kindermann2017} measured the geometry of an NMC --with unknown stoichiometry-- electrode, extracted from a Samsung cell.\cite{Kindermann2017} 
Electrode diffusivity and reaction rates were estimated and not evaluated directly, while the equilibrium potential was represented by that of an NMC111 material reported elsewhere.\cite{Stewart_2008} 

Parameterisation is essential for modelling NMC cathode materials, as simulations act as a powerful tool to investigate the properties of NMC and optimise design without the need to conduct resource-intensive experiments.\cite{shearing_2020_3D} 
Several NMC batteries with low nickel content have been experimentally parameterized.\cite{Ecker2015,Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018,Liebig_2019}
\citeauthor{Ecker2015} reported the physico-chemical properties and anatomy of a LiNi$_{0.4}$Co$_{0.6}$O$_2$-based pouch cell, offering a comparison of different techniques used to evaluate the electrode diffusivity.\cite{Ecker2015} \citeauthor{Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018} investigated an NMC111 battery, mapping the exchange current density, its activation energy, and electrode diffusivity as a function of lithiation, by defining the stoichiometries of each electrode.\cite{Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018} 
\citeauthor{Liebig_2019} studied the electrochemical behaviour of a large format NMC cell, extending the model predictions to include thermal behaviour.\cite{Liebig_2019} 
These papers outline the cell properties required for simulations and the methods used to determine them.
These methodologies detail a procedure that can be applied to other materials, proving a valuable tool for other groups to undertake similar investigations. 
For modellers investigating high-Ni NMC materials these properties provide limited utility, as they do not accurately describe its behaviour. 
This can be attributed to the different NMC crystal structures significantly affecting their electrochemical properties.\cite{noh2013comparison} 

It is difficult to predict the values of parameters for high-Ni materials, based on the determined values for lower Ni-content materials.\cite{Amin_Chiang_2016} 
This is attributed to the presence of different thermodynamic phases compared to NMC811, which affects the dependency of several parameters on the state of lithiation. 
The H2 $\rightarrow$ H3 phase transition above 4.1V has not been reported in NMCs with Ni content below 80\% and this can explain parameter differences.\cite{jung2017oxygen} 
Thermodynamic phases in materials are property-determinant.
To address the limited contributions in this context, authors have focused on specifically parameterizing NMC811 chemistries. 
\citeauthor{Chen2020} detailed the parameters for a commercially available 21700 cylindrical cell, validating and tuning these values for cell discharge.\cite{Chen2020} 
\citeauthor{Sturm2019} reported a full electrochemical-parameterization of a DFN model, to study lithium plating during fast charging of a NMC811/SiC cell.\cite{Sturm2019b,Sturm2019} 
It can be time-consuming to conduct literature searches to find parameters, to develop the code to simulate battery behaviour, and to collect the data to validate model predictions. 
The availability of software and data continues to be essential in enabling innovations in this field.

Traditionally, the sourcing of parameters required an extensive literature search and/or knowledge of prominent authors in the field. 
Recently, the development of databases and software that collate parameter values for battery components have streamlined this process and proved essential in modelling applications.\cite{Tranter2020,Tranter_2020b} 
\citeauthor{Wang} created a database that details over 100 parameterisations of batteries or the individual components and techniques that have been used to determine them. 
Additionally, Python Battery Mathematical Modelling (PyBaMM) is a software package that has been explicitly developed for continuum modelling, catering for multiple definitions and allowing the construction of a battery from various component chemistries.\cite{Sulzer_2020} 
These include parameters for the commercial NMC811 electrode mentioned above.\cite{Chen2020} 
The parameter set for this material has been utilised in multiple investigations.\cite{Tranter2020,Tranter_2020b} 
PyBaMM provides a robust approach to modelling of NMC, among other materials, as the electrochemical behaviour can be simulated with relatively few lines of code (Figure \ref{fig:pybamm}).

Model predictions require validation with experimental data. 
The validation requirements often call for long-term cycling experiments that many institutions do not have the facilities to carry out themselves. 
Providing these data sets via open access repositories enables researchers to more readily find the data they require for model development. 
Data availability in science is critical for progress and this is especially true in model development. Providing parameter values and raw experimental data improves accessibility and transparency, leading to better research throughout the community. 
We would like to highlight the following instances of validation data. \citeauthor{Chen2020} have made available data on the discharge and subsequent relaxation of the NMC811-based cylindrical cell that was used in the validation of the parameter set (Ref.~\citenum{zenodo}).\cite{Chen2020}
\citeauthor{Devie_2018} have provided data sets on the degradation of 18650 cylindrical cells, based on NMC, NCA, and LFP chemistries. The study is ongoing and examines the influence of operating conditions on the ageing of cells (Ref.~\citenum{BatteryArchive}).\cite{Devie_2018}

Parameterisation is a critical exercise in model development, additionally providing useful insights into the properties of a lithium-ion battery and its components. 
It is important to be aware of the nuances in reported parameter values, specifically that different techniques provide considerably different information and that modelling predictions are most accurate when the parameters have been explicitly determined for the battery being studied. 
The availability of parameters and validation data has proven valuable to the research community and software has been developed in this context. 
For example, PyBaMM is a powerful tool, providing researchers with parameter sets and robust code.

The thermal and electrochemical behaviours of battery materials have been widely described, however, being able to accurately predict the degradation has proven more difficult. 
This can be ascribed to the difficulty in measuring the required parameters; presently, many of these parameters are assumed or fitted. 

%\subsection{Degradation: Identifying and Predicting (Anisha)}
Experimental characterisation of physical and chemical properties provides essential data for creating accurate parameters and validating models to identify and investigate battery degradation processes. 
Both electrodes are susceptible to a range of degradation modes affecting the impedance, power, and capacity of a cell. 
\citeauthor{Edge2021Degradation} provide a detailed guide to understanding these modes, the mechanisms causing them, and the resulting effects, in order to design experiments or develop models for investigating battery degradation.\cite{Edge2021Degradation} 
There are two key degradation modes for the NMC positive electrode material which directly affect impedance, power, and capacity: loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active material (LAM).\cite{erickson2017recent,erickson2017recent}
Repeated cycling causes volume changes, resulting in particle cracking,\cite{Woodford2010} and leading to loss of contact between particles and the current collector.\cite{erickson2017recent} 
The cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer which forms in the cracks triggers side reactions with the electrolyte, leading to passivation layer formation and consumption of lithium ions, i.e. LLI and hence impedance increase.\cite{erickson2017recent}
Operating at high voltages ($\geq$3.7~V) also promotes CEI formation, as well as other detrimental surface processes, such as gas evolution (\ce{O2}, \ce{CO2}, and \ce{CO}).\cite{jung2017chemical} 
NMC811 has a higher susceptibility towards oxygen evolution, due to its higher nickel content.\cite{Phillip2020} 
Long term cycling and operating at high voltages and temperatures causes dissolution of transition metals.\cite{li2018temperature} 
NMC811 has a higher susceptibility to this, again due to the reactivity of highly oxidised nickel cations with the electrolyte.\cite{billy2018dissolution} 
Accurate prediction of cell behaviour requires monitoring of these processes and deciphering of the interplay between processes.
This is done by physical and chemical characterisation, providing essential data for parameterisation and validation of models, leading towards the design of more realistic models which can accurately predict a cell's remaining life.

Degradation mechanisms of the positive electrode can be investigated using the continuum scale models, SPM\cite{reniers2019review,jana2019physical} and DFN.\cite{lin2013comprehensive} 
For example, oxygen evolution from the positive electrode is conventionally modelled as the oxidation of electrolytes at the positive electrode, introducing a simple, kinetically limited Tafel equation\cite{lin2013comprehensive,reniers2019review} in the DFN or SPM model. 
\citeauthor{jana2019physical} proposed that the capacity fade is a linear function of the oxidation current density, which the authors used in the Tafel equation to model the electrolyte oxidation at the positive electrode.\cite{jana2019physical} 
However, theoretical understanding and available models for the source of the oxygen evolution and its effect on the capacity fade are not well developed. 
Recently, \citeauthor{ghosh2020shrinking} have proposed a physics-based shrinking core model for the degradation of NMC811 electrodes, that undergo a structural reorganisation involving oxygen loss and the formation of a disordered (spinel or rock-salt structure) passivation layer (PL). \cite{ghosh2020shrinking} 
The model considers [O] released from the bulk-PL interface and reaction kinetics of the same control reaction rate. 
Li-entrapment and growth of the PL cause capacity fade. 
Two limiting cases, \textit{`diffusion dominated'} and \textit{`reaction dominated'}, manifest with the variation in the relative rates of [O]-diffusion and [O]-release, and the thickness of the PL. 
Transition metal dissolution at the positive electrode is modelled using a first order chemical reaction, limited by the concentration of \ce{H+} ions in the electrolyte.\cite{dai2012capacity} 
\ce{H+} ions are generated from \ce{LiPF6} salt dissociation in the electrolyte and solvent oxidation at the positive electrode. 
While \ce{LiPF6} dissociation in the presence of \ce{H2O} is modelled using a chemical reaction rate, solvent oxidation is modelled using irreversible Butler-Volmer kinetics.\cite{dai2012capacity} 
\citeauthor{lin2013comprehensive} provide detailed DFN model equations for transition metal dissolution at the positive electrode, coupled with SEI layer formation at the negative electrode.
Transition metal deposition on the negative electrode is also included in the model.\cite{lin2013comprehensive} 
The growth of the CEI can be modelled in a similar way to any of the SEI layer growth models.

Key degradation processes that take place at the positive electrode material and their effects have been discussed and fundamental characterisation techniques that aide tracking and monitoring of these processes have been introduced. In order to use models to estimate aging mechanisms during normal or even fast charging, accurate determination of the parameters that describe the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the cell is key. The reliability of models to predict a cell's behaviour, which is highly dependent on the type of cell, requires experimental data. Electrochemical techniques are fast and practical diagnostic tools used in \textit{in situ} characterization of battery performance, providing information on capacity, resistance, and coulombic efficiency. The use of multiple approaches produces rich data, required for cell monitoring and deciphering of the degradation processes taking place during cell cycling. This data is also essential for accurate parameterization and validation of models, leading to more realistic models for accurate prediction of cell lifetime.

\section*{Summary and Outlook}
We have reviewed progress in the computer simulation of NMC electrodes, from the atomic to the cell scale. Looking at each length scale, a number of outstanding challenges can be identified.
For electronic structure studies, proper elucidation of the oxidation states of mixed transition metals in NMC is important for improving its applicability as a cathode in LIBs.
Layered oxides with high Ni content have three critical challenges: cyclic instability, thermal instability, and air instability, all of which are related to the instability of Ni$^{3+}$ or Ni$^{4+}$ in contact with the liquid organic electrolyte or ambient air.\cite{Manthiram-NatComm-2020}
The mixed nature of transition metals also impacts the thermodynamic stability of NMC materials.
Analysis of the thermodynamics to obtain accurate interatomic force constants for the material is crucial.
These are acquired through extensive first principles calculations of systematic finite differences.
However, this approach scales poorly with system size and structural symmetry and is therefore too expensive to extend beyond third-order interatomic force constants.
An alternative method would be to use machine learning, comprising models that learn from existing large data sets to make predictions.
For example, a newly developed package based on machine learning, hiPhive, enables the efficient extraction from first principles calculations using regression techniques with regularization.\cite{eriksson2019hiphive}

For molecular dynamics studies, a bottleneck is the lack of interatomic potentials with the ability to accurately describe essential properties for a battery material, such as the redox chemistry.
To achieve this, fitting to better training data, and potentially more sophisticated functional forms are needed.
Progress has also been made in using machine learning to develop new, more reliable, potentials. \citeauthor{deringer2019machine} recently published a progress update, showing how machine learning is improving interatomic potentials by ``learning'' from electronic structure data, giving better accuracy in approximating material properties.\cite{deringer2019machine}

Inaccuracies in continuum models manifest due to the lack of original parameter sets in literature and improper experimental design.
Realistic models for predicting cell lifetime and managing operation require a comprehensive understanding of the degradation processes.
To obtain representative data, more physical and chemical characterisation is needed.
The use of multiple diagnostic tools produces rich data, essential for accurate parameterization and validation of models, leading towards the design of more realistic models for accurate prediction of cells life.
However, information in literature may not be representative of the material being modelled and mistakes can easily be propagated.\cite{Howey_2020}
Extensive parameterization of high Ni content NMC stoichiometries is needed to avoid use of data from lower Ni materials, which are not suitably representative, having significantly different properties.
Further to this, construction of a parameter database would prevent reproduction of errors.
Equally important is having a holistic understanding of the experimental techniques and model assumptions.
The theory underpinning the experiments used in parameterization must be consistent with that of the model to make truly robust predictions.
There are several research groups around the world currently working towards addressing these problems.

Continuum models of high Ni electrode degradation are key to revealing the underlying physics of the degradation mechanisms.
In addition, whole-cell LIB models are incomplete without the inclusion of positive electrode degradation mechanisms.
Therefore, modelling individual degradation mechanisms and incorporating them into whole-cell models is the future goal, but accurate parameterization will be key for this to succeed.
Degradation experiments and fundamental molecular scale, including DFT, studies are essential for the development of whole-cell degradation models.\cite{Sulzer_2020}
These models will then be capable of predicting the lifetime of these batteries and identifying key conditions for extending their useful lives.

Connecting continuum and atomistic model predictions can provide a more detailed understanding of the charge and mass transport processes, resulting in more accurate predictions of battery behaviour.
Attempts to join the atomistic to the continuum scale have previously been attempted, however, there is no simple method for joining the different length scales, due to the difference in mathematical principles used in each model.\cite{Fackeldey2015}
Continuum models comprise of partial differential equations (PDEs), while atomistic models use discrete models.\cite{Badia2007}
This difference in mathematical principles leads to different calculable properties.
For example, in atomistic modelling, charge transport is related to self-diffusion within the crystal lattice, whereas charge transport in continuum modelling relates to macroscopic diffusion in the electrode, often being experimentally determined.
Solutions to overcome this mismatch in calculable properties are of great interest and one of the biggest challenges in obtaining consistent, multiscale models of battery materials.
