\begin{abstract}
The first generation of cathodes in commercial lithium-ion batteries are based on layered transition metal oxides. Research on ternary compounds such as LiCoO$_2$ evolved into mixed-metal systems, notably Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O$_2$ (NMC), which allows significant tuning of the physical properties. Despite its widespread application in commercial devices, the fundamental understanding of NMC is limited. Here, we review the latest insights from multi-scale modelling, bridging between the redox phenomena that occur at an atomistic level to the transport of ions and electrons across an operating device. We discuss changes in the electronic and vibrational structure through the NMC compositional space and how these link to continuum models of electrochemical charge/discharge cycling. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges for predictive models of high-performance batteries including capturing the relevant device bottlenecks and chemical degradation processes such as oxygen evolution.

%\section{Introduction (all)}

% Rechargeable batteries – Li batteries, current uses, need to improve.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were first developed by Whittingham in the 1970s \cite{whittingham1974hydrated,whittingham1976electrical} but did not become a promising material until 1979 when Goodenough and Mizushima successfully demonstrated \ce{LiCoO2} as a cathode.\cite{mizushima1980lixcoo2} 
These were successfully commercialized by Sony in 1991 and have since become instrumental in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage applications.\cite{armand2008building,scrosati2011lithium,goodenough2013li,etacheri2011challenges,he2012layered,rozier2015li,dunn2011electrical} 
However, to fully electrify the transport and energy sectors further advancements in LIBs are required to achieve higher energy densities, better longevity, and lower cost. 
The performance of a battery is highly dependant on the choice of cathode material and the transition metals they are composed of.\cite{Sari2019,Julien2014,whittingham2008materials,bruce2012li}

% Introduce Cathode – limiting factor, composite materials (NMC).
\ce{LiCoO2} offered a number of attractive features including ease of synthesis, reversible lithium insertion, high specific energy density, and high thermal stability.\cite{gibbard1989high,plichta1989improved} 
However, its application was limited due to capacity fade and the cost/geopolitical issues of cobalt mining, which made large scale energy storage solutions impractical. \cite{mo_impact_2018,Banza2009}. 
Other oxide materials such as \ce{LiNiO2} and Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ were considered, however, they have their own challenges, such as the longevity and safety of \ce{LiNiO2}, \cite{min_comparative_2016} and Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ showing irreversible structural changes due to Jahn-Teller effects and low capacity \cite{tian_performance_2018}. Partial replacement of Co in \ce{LiCoO2} with Ni and Mn was considered, resulting in the layered oxide Li[Ni$_x$Mn$_y$Co$_z$]O$_2$, where $x+y+z=1$, commonly termed NMC, with subsequent numbers relating to the ratio of the transition metals.\cite{paulsen2000o2,paulsen20002, lu2001layered,rozier2015li} 
These NMC materials were able to achieve a more balanced performance, preserving favourable voltage characteristics, reaching a higher capacity (\SI{200}{mA.h.g^{-1}}), and addressing cost and abundance issues. \cite{sun_electronic_2017,larcher2015towards,ohzuku2001layered} 
NMC also demonstrates improved electrochemical performance, enhanced rate capability \cite{noh2013comparison,dahn1991rechargeable}, and better cycle life/thermal stability \cite{kim2006synthesis,armstrong1996synthesis}.

%Going to Ni rich and NMC811
The tuning of the transition metal (TM) compositions of NMC has been a focus of research, in an effort to optimise desirable battery properties including capacity, cyclic rate, electrochemical stability, and lifetime, whilst also reducing cost. \cite{duan2019insights} Most NMC compositions are already in use, with commercial applications shifting from NMC111 to higher Ni compositions including NMC811 (Li[Ni$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$]O$_2$). \cite{zhang2018structural} 
Current investigations are now focused towards further reducing the Co content and optimising NMC811 to improve the performance of current and future-generation batteries for long-range electric vehicles \cite{azevedo2018mining} and for use in all-solid-state LIBs. \cite{myung2017nickel,ohzuku_layered_2001, lu2001layered,belharouak2003li,kim2014unexpected,sun_electronic_2017}

%Challenges for NMC811 
Despite the improved properties of NMC811, the material still exhibits fast voltage and capacity fading as well as poor structural and thermal stability\cite{noh2013comparison,Li-aenm-2019,Jerng-ACS-AMI-2020}, which lead to severe degradation. \cite{Zhang-acs.chemmater-2019,Feng-2019,Xia2018,De-AdMat-2019,Li_Nat-Comm-2017,Manthiram-NatComm-2020} Degradation can occur through a range of physical and chemical processes resulting in loss of lithium inventory (LLI), loss of active material (LAM), and/or impedance increase.\cite{vetter2005ageing} 
Attempts have been made to circumvent these degradation processes using approaches including surface coating, doping with ions, and electrolyte modification;\cite{maleki2019controllable,Liu-JSSE-2020} however, current experimental probes are limited in the detail they can provide. 
Additional challenges lie in improving safety and prolonging life of batteries, which requires optimal thermal and operational management. 
This is where computational modelling can provide greater insight.

%Modelling techniques
Atomistic techniques, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and continuum techniques, including the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model and its simplification the single-particle model (SPM) \cite{Newman1975porous, Doyle1993DFN} broadly describe battery modelling techniques from atom to cell level. \cite{Howey_2020} 
DFT is well suited for investigating electronic structure, whereas MD, either \textit{ab-initio} or classical, can be used to provide vital information on system dynamics. These atomistic models can provide insights into material properties, however, they are limited by scale. 
Continuum modelling, a larger scale computational technique, is better placed to provide cell level properties. 
The DFN model assumes the electrodes are comprised of a homogeneous matrix of spherical particles and is able to predict the dynamics and internal states (Li concentration within active materials) of a battery. The SPM is a further simplification that considers one representative particle.
%In battery research these are the most commonly used continuum models due to their parameter requirements. This class of model is afforded accuracy, however computational expense currently precludes use in commercial applications including battery management systems. 
Combining atomistic and continuum model predictions, within a multi-scale modelling framework, can provide a more detailed understanding of the charge and mass transport processes, resulting in more accurate predictions of battery behaviour.

% review outline -  Motivation and what our review is about.
In this Review, drawn from our experience as part of the multi-scale modelling fast-start project of the Farday Institution, we highlight the importance of modelling NMC across length and time scales. 
%Firstly, we start at the atomistic scale, discuss the importance of transition metal oxide states and the roles they play in degradation processes, presenting work which has recently furthered this understanding. We discuss modelling of ion diffusion in NMC, presenting insight into the challenges posed by the material and the considerations needed for classical modelling. Continuing with the dynamics properties, we discuss vibrational structure and thermal transport in NMC, using the lattice dynamics of the crystalline material, discussing phonon dispersion and density, and the Jahn-Teller effect. We then move to the continuum scale, discussing the parameterisation of DFN models, key NMC degradation mechanisms and experimental characterisation techniques, and the modelling of degradation mechanisms of NMC electrodes specifically the phase transitions of the NMC surfaces during charging at higher state of charges (SOCs). 
We also provide an outlook to current and future challenges faced in the modelling of NMC and other multi-component cathode materials.

\section*{Electrons: Oxidation State Competition}
The practical use of Ni-rich NMC materials in LIBs faces various challenges including structural degradation and capacity fading.  
The redox reactions and consequent reversible capacity of NMC are primarily influenced by the cation ordering and spin interaction of active elements in the TM layers. \cite{Li-acsami-2020,Maleki-aenm.2019,Feng-2019, Xia2018, Xiao_NanoEner2018}. 
Different compositions and charge distributions result in the appearance of various valence states, e.g. Ni$^{2+}$, Ni$^{3+}$, Ni$^{4+}$, Co$^{3+}$, Co$^{4+}$, Mn$^{4+}$. \cite{Xiao_NanoEner2018} 
The coexistence and interactions of these multivalent TM chargess and spins make it difficult to determine a unique ground state for NMCs. \cite{Xiao_NanoEner2018}
Understanding the range of transition metal oxidation states, and the roles they play in degradation processes, is therefore crucial for the improvement of these promising cathode materials.

Ni is a key redox active element in NMC. Experimentally, Ni in NMC811 is present as a mixture of Ni$^{2+}$ (with electronic configuration of ${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{2}$) and Ni$^{3+}$ (${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{1}$) oxidation states, with an average value close to 3+. \cite{Zhu_JMatChemA2019,Katharina-chemmater,Kondrakov_JPhysChemC2017} 
During charging-discharging cycling, the Ni$^{2+}$  can migrate from the Ni plane (3a) to the Li plane (3b), creating a Li/Ni disorder. \cite{Zhang-acs.chemmater-2019, Feng-2019, Xia2018} This leads to a structural transformation (layered to defect spinel/disordered rock-salt transition) and blocks the Li$^{+}$  migration channels.\cite{Xia2018} Ni$^{4+}$ (${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{0}$) 
This is thought to be the origin of cracking and subsequent performance degradation upon lithium extraction.\cite{Katharina-chemmater,Li-aenm-2019,Li-EER-2020}   
The dissolution of NMC, resulting in capacity attenuation, can occur due to the TM disproportionation.\cite{buchberger2015} 
Ni disproportionation in pristine NMC811 has not been reported experimentally. 
In a previous computational study \cite{HChen_PhysRevB2011}, $2$Ni$^{3+}\rightarrow$Ni$^{2+} + $Ni$^{4+}$, has been discussed for LiNiO$_2$. 
Charge disproportionation is observed in other cathode materials such as in pristine LiMn$_2$O$_4$ where  $2$Mn$^{3+}\rightarrow$Mn$^{2+} + $Mn$^{4+}$ disproportionation is considered to be the main responsible for Mn dissolution. Elucidation of active metal disproportionation in NMCs is important as it poses a threat of poisoning the anode \cite{Parmar-LMO-2020,PASQUALINI2017} and forming inorganic layers in SEIs \cite{joshi2014}, which in turn lead to the capacity fading. 

The complex ordering and multivalent nature of transition metals poses significant challenges for modelling.
Previous theoretical investigations have studied the influence of oxidation states on various properties of NMC materials. \cite{Dan-Thomas-chemmater,Sun_JPhysChemC2017,Dixit_JPhysChemC2017,Hoang_ACSChemMater2016,Dixit_JElecSoc2017}  These studies, employing the DFT+\textit{U} approach to treat the high correlation of the TM 3d orbitals, have calculated Jahn-Teller distortion effects, atomic magnetic moments and density of states for the elucidation of TMs oxidation states. 
Ni$^{2+}$ is predominant over Ni$^{3+}$ in NMC333, NMC442, and NMC532, whereas with the increase of Ni content, the occupation of Ni$^{3+}$ steadily increases at the cost of Ni$^{2+}$. 
In NMC811, the Ni$^{3+}$  fraction is up to 58 \%. \cite{ Sun_JPhysChemC2017} 
The presence of Ni$^{4+}$ is observed at delithiation conditions and the concentration increases rapidly in Ni-rich NMC materials as a function of Li content. \cite{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017} 
Sun and Zhao \cite{ Sun_JPhysChemC2017} have reported the existence of Co$^{2+}$ ions along with Co$^{3+}$  ions in pristine NMCs, which was opposed by \citeauthor{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017}\cite{ Dixit_JPhysChemC2017}. 
Based on magnetic moments and PDOS calculations it was concluded that Co remains as Co$^{3+}$ in different pristine NMCs. Mn$^{4+}$ remains in close proximity to Ni$^{2+}$ which influences the super-exchange interactions among transition metals. \cite{zheng2019} In NMC materials with mixed valence states of Ni$^{2+}$/ Ni$^{3+}$, Ni$^{3+}$  has the priority to exchange with Li and changes to a Ni$^{2+}$ state with a spin-flip, to form strong linear Ni$^{2+}$–O2–– Ni$^{2+}$ /Mn$^{4+}$ super-exchange networks. 
This acts as the driving force in tuning the Ni/Li disordering. \cite{zheng2019,Zheng-acs.jpclett-2017}

% AW - IS THIS A REVIEW OR NEW RESULTS?
% I DIDNT EDIT THIS SECTION YET
%
Recently, \re{\citeauthor{rana}} have employed HF-DFT hybrid HSE06 functional coupled with Wannier function analysis to assign oxidation states in Ni rich NMC811 (LiNi$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$O$_{2}$). \cite{rana} The effect of transition metal ordering and oxidation state configuration on the relative stability of different NMC811 models was studied. The limitations of other approaches to assign oxidation states, such as analysis of magnetic moments and Jahn-Teller distortions, were also illustrated.

%\subsection{Stability and Oxidation State Distribution in NMC-811}
By randomly varying the atomic positions of Ni, Mn and Co in the lattice, \re{\citeauthor{rana}} created 50 structural models of NMC811. The total energy values of these structures were calculated by full optimization of the fractional coordinates and the lattice parameters. The calculated energies depend on the transition metal arrangement, resulting in preferred TM configurations. This finding is in contrast to recent suggestions that the transition metal cations in NMC811 are randomly distributed. \cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017} The stability of the NMC811 varies due to the distribution and interaction of mixed oxidation states of the TM ions (Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$/Ni$^{4+}$, Co$^{3+}$, and Mn$^{4+}$). This is in line with the experimental observations that the spin interactions of TM ions influence the ground state stability of NMC. \cite{Xiao_NanoEner2018}  Figure \ref{fig:stability}(a) presents the proportion of Ni ions in a given oxidation state for all considered models obtained with the HSE06 functional, ordered by relative energies per formula unit. \cite{rana} The distribution of transition metals is the only difference between these 50 NMC811 models. Therefore, it is clear that the relative energies of NMC811 structures depends strongly on how the mixed oxidation state transition metals are ordered and the interactions between them.

\end{figure}

The analysis of the \% of Ni shows a mixture of Ni states, Figure \ref{fig:stability}(b). Nickel in NMC811 has been reported as having a mix of Ni(II/III) oxidation states, with the average value close to 3+, \cite{Zhu_JMatChemA2019,Kondrakov_JPhysChemC2017} which could potentially be rationalised by a simple distribution \{1 Ni$^{2+}$;7 Ni$^{3+}$;1 Mn$^{4+}$; 1 Co$^{3+}$\} oxidation state model. Several instances of this simple oxidation state distribution was found within \citeauthor{rana}'s data set. The two lowest energy structures here account for this oxidation state distribution. On examining the transition metal ordering in these lowest energy structures it can be seen that Mn$^{4+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ lie in adjacent 3b sites along the shortest crystal axis. It forms continuous linear chains of alternating Mn$^{4+}$-Ni$^{2+}$ throughout all transition metal layers. This long range linear chain ordering is consistent with local charge balance, as discussed by \citeauthor{Zeng_ChemMater2007} \cite{Zeng_ChemMater2007}. As the two lowest energy structures contain this transition metal ordering, it suggests that the main stabilising effect of these models are the result of extended Mn$^{4+}$-Ni$^{2+}$ coordination. However, it should be noted that with the increase of supercell size, the probability of Mn$^{4+}$-Ni$^{2+}$ residing next to each other might reduce.

In a large proportion of NMC811 configurations \citeauthor{rana} investigated, $2$Ni$^{3+}\rightarrow$Ni$^{2+} + $Ni$^{4+}$ disproportionation is also observed. This occurs in some of the most stable structures in the data set, for example see the third most stable model in Figure \ref{fig:stability}(b). It can therefore be concluded that $2$Ni$^{3+}\rightarrow$Ni$^{2+} + $Ni$^{4+}$ disproportionation occurs in the pristine NMC811 structure before charging, illustrating that Ni$^{4+}$ is present in the fully lithiated material rather than only appearing on lithium deintercalation.

Analysis of the Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion effects is a popular approach for the identification of the oxidation states. Recently, Sun and Zhao have determined the oxidation states of TMs in NMC by analysing the JT effect and TM–O bond length. \cite{Sun_JPhysChemC2017} In \citeauthor{rana}, it was clearly demonstrated that JT distortion is not adequate to unambiguously assign the TMs oxidation states. The low-spin Ni$^{3+}$ state with a singly occupied orbital at the $e_{g}$ level is a JT active species. In Figure \ref{fig:JT}, the calculated Ni--O octahedral bond lengths found within \citeauthor{rana}'s data set are presented. It is observed that while it is possible to identify Ni$^{3+}$-O Jahn-Teller distorted complexes within the entire data set, the transition metal ordering leads to competition between local strain effects and Jahn-Teller distortion. The amount of distortion varies significantly. Therefore it is difficult to assign the oxidation states by distortion alone.  

\begin{figure}[tb]

    \caption{\label{fig:JT} Histogram showing Ni-O octahedral bond lengths separated by Wannier function assigned oxidation state, along with a Gaussian kernel density estimation. Reproduced with permissions from \citenum{rana}.}
\end{figure}

Calculation of atomic magnetic moment is another approach to assign oxidation states which was employed in previous computational studies. \cite{Dixit_JPhysChemC2017, Zheng-acs.jpclett-2017}. 
In fig.\ \ref{fig:Mag}, the calculated atomic magnetic moments for all Ni ions in \citeauthor{rana}'s data set are presented. It is observed that there is a 
continuous range of magnetic moments which highlights the ambiguity inherent in this approach.
This may lead to incorrect assignment of oxidation states in some cases.
For example, as shown in fig.\ \ref{fig:Mag} (b), the Wannier functions assigned to a Ni ion in one of the structures has a clear ${t_{2g}}^{6}{e_{g}}^{2}$ electronic configuration corresponding to Ni$^{2+}$. \citeauthor{rana} But DFT calculated magnetic moment was found in the range of low spin Ni$^{3+}$ as shown in the central region of fig.\ \ref{fig:Mag}(a).\citeauthor{rana} This demonstrates that magnetic moment can not always assign oxidation state correctly.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

This study \citenum{rana} showed that the transformation of Kohn-Sham electronic states to Wannier functions and then using the centre of gravity to associate each with an ion gives the most unambiguous description of oxidation states in NMC811. The findings from this study are important for the improvement of electrochemical behaviour of cathodes as well as for the understanding of structural degradation of LIBs during cycling. Further studies on the effects of delithiation and doping on transition metal oxidation states are currently underway to extend the understanding of NMC materials.

\section*{Ions: Models of Diffusion}
%\subsection*{Interatomic Potentials}
Understanding ion diffusion is crucial for the development of batteries with high‐power density, especially in solid electrodes which present slow ion diffusion compared to electrolytes. 
The rate of diffusion can be understood through the diffusion coefficient, $D$. 
DFT is well suited to investigate local hopping mechanisms;\cite{van_der_ven_layered_2001, van_der_ven_LiTiS2_2008} however, when it comes to long range diffusion classical MD is better suited in terms of longer time- and length-scales. 
Here, the chemical bonding is described using interatomic potentials. 
There are many forms of interatomic potentials, with the ablility to describe heteropolar solids such as NMC. 
The most widely used form for investigating diffusion properties is the Coulomb-Buckingham potential. \cite{buckingham_classical_1938} 
This is derived from the Born model\cite{born_1932, mayer_1932}, where the potential energy of the system is expressed as:
%
\begin{equation}
    E(r_{ij}) =  \sum_{ij} \frac{Q_i Q_j}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_{ij}} + \sum_{ij} A \ exp(\frac{-r_{ij}}{\rho}) - Cr_{ij}^{-6}
\end{equation}
%
Here, $i$ and $j$ are ions of charge $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ at a distance of $r_{ij}$ and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. In the second term $A$, $\rho$, and $C$ are the parameters associated with the Buckingham potential.

The sole classical MD study reported for NMC111  employed core-shell Buckingham potentials. \cite{Lee_and_Park_2012} 
Using these potentials for a range of NMC compositions, however, presented  catastrophic structural collapse upon removing Li (Figure \ref{fig:structure_collapse}). Ni in NMC111 is Ni$^{2+}$, whereas in delithiated structures and other compositions, other oxidation states, such as Ni$^{3+}$ arise. Similarly, delithiation results in the formation of mixed Ni oxidation states and charge disproportion, which is challenging to represent in a classical model. \cite{Nakamura_2019,Kim_2002,Alonso_1999} 
The complex nature of Ni chemistry extends to the LiNiO$_2$ ternary system. To the best of our knowledge, no interatomic potentials exist for Ni$^{3+}$, evidenced by a lack of classical MD publications for LiNiO$_2$ and NMC systems. %Development of new interatomic potentials is therefore necessary.

\end{figure}

%\subsection{Developing Interatomic Potentials}
The development of interatomic potentials, which requires model paramaterization with respect to a set of target observables is a difficult task for systems of such complexity.  
For layered structures, variations of the Buckingham potentials have been developed, some using rigid ion models,\cite{Lewis_1985, Ledwaba2020, Sayle2005, Dawson2014} and others using core-shell models, \cite{Hart1998, Fisher2010, Lewis_1985,Ammundsen1999, Kerisit2014, He2019,lee2012atomistic} with a mixture of formal and partial charges. 
%As literature is in disagreement over most representative variation of the Buckingham potential, fitting and comparing different permutations of the Buckingham potential is needed. Interatomic potentials are most commonly based on mathematical functions parameterised using experimental and/or ab-initio derived data. \cite{jones_1924, buckingham_classical_1938} 
We attempted to apply the fitting routines from established codes including  the General Utility Lattice Program (GULP), \cite{gale_gulp_1997} Atomicrex, \cite{Stukowski_2017} dftfit, \cite{dftfit} and potfit. \cite{wen_kim-compliant_2017} 
These codes poses individual features, however, none were able to produce robust potentials for NMC or LiNiO$_2$.
BuckFit,\cite{Morgan2020BuckFit} has been specifically developed within the Faraday Institution for fitting different permutations of the Buckingham potential. Its modular design allows flexible fitting of both rigid ion and core-shell models, and formal and partial charges. Here, we review important aspects determined to be vital when fitting cathode potentials using this code.

In systems such as NMC and LiNiO$_2$ the short-range interactions are overwhelmed by the longer-range Coulombic term. 
In these cases, the system charges need to be scaled down to increase the influence of the short-range interactions, termed as partial charges. 
A scaling factor of 60 \% formal charge is commonly used, \cite{pedone2006potentials} however, partial charges are system dependant. 
Figure \ref{fig:charge_scaling} shows $\chi^2$ (fit error) for a fitted Buckingham potential for LiNiO$_2$ reduces with the charge scaling factor until approximately 60 \% of the formal charge, where it starts to plateau. This is in broad agreement with literature, with a slightly improved fit at $\sim$50 \% formal charge.

    \caption{\label{fig:charge_scaling} Plot of the fit error (mean squared error, $\chi^2$) of LiNiO$_2$ as a function of the charge scaling factor.}
\end{figure}

Core-shell models introduce polarizability into classical MD simulations. The adiabatic shell model \cite{Mitchell_1993} has been widely used for calculating long trajectories. 
A fraction of the atomic mass is assigned to the shell and there is no explicitly defined fraction size; however, placing 10 \% of the atomic mass on the shell is commonly adopted. \cite{PLIMPTON19951,todorov2006dl_poly_3} 
%An additional consideration is the separation of the formal atomic charge across the core and shell. %However, determined numerical values of the core-shell charge separation are inconsistent. \cite{wang2014molecular,escribano2017enhancing,lee2012atomistic,Lee2013_lithium,dai2019comparison}

Fitting  rigid ion potentials for LiNiO$_2$ (with partial charges) resulted with a best fit of $\chi^2$ = 1.665.
By introducing a core-shell potential on the oxygen, with Li and Ni remaining rigid ion, $\chi^2$ was reduced to 0.372. 
Presenting evidence that a core-shell potential is required to more accurately reproduce the forces and physics of the system. In the case of the oxygen core-shell the spring constant was determined to be 15.443 eV $\cdot$\AA$^{-2}$, with a charge of -1.48 e on the shell and 0.520 e on the core.
Here, the best fit (lowest mean squared error) was a core-shell model on the oxygen in a partial charged system. The resulting potential was used with a 10 \% delithiated LiNiO$_2$ supercell to conduct MD studies at 700 K on the diffusion within the material. The MSD, Figure \ref{fig:MSD_LiNiO2}, presents small movement of Li, however, the resulting self-diffusion coefficient, 6.664$\times 10^{-8}$  cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$, is within the measured range. \cite{Nakamura2000,bruce1992vacancy}
These results indicate that core-shell and partial charges are necessary to include in interatomic potential models for these systems.

\section*{Phonons: Thermal Transport}
 A traditional image of crystals is that of atoms  being held in static positions through stiff chemical bonds. 
 In reality, atoms are constantly vibrating around their average crystallographic positions in even the hardest of crystals.
  Lattice dynamics, based on calculation of the interatomic force constants in a crystal, is a powerful tool to model thermal effects from heat capacity to thermal expansion. 
  Recently, the description of anharmonic effects including vibrational lifetimes and thermal conductivity has become possible.

There have been a number of studies on the thermal properties of NMC. 
Recently, \citeauthor{yang2020chemical} reported the harmonic phonon dispersion for the \ce{LiMO2} (M = Ni, Co, Mn) endpoints in the NMC oxide system. \cite{yang2020chemical} Their results revel that the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect is more pronounced in the crystalline \ce{LiMnO2} with three distinct bond lengths for the TM-O bonds. They found that the medium and low frequency modes are mainly due to motion of Li and TMs, while the high frequency modes ($>$ 14 THz) are vibrations involving the TM and O atoms. The phonons also provide information of a group, theoretic analysis within the group assigns the irreducible representations of the acoustic and optic branches. Of these, some modes are infra-red (IR) active or Raman active, which is comparable with experimental IR/Raman spectra, with differences likely due to the volume expansion at finite temperature. \cite{yang2019highly} For NMC alloy systems, \citeauthor{sun_electronic_2017} showed that longitudional acoustic mode frequency increases from NMC333 to NMC811 (Figure \ref{figure_phonon}) due to the weaker electron screening.\cite{sun_electronic_2017}

%kappa, real device, impact
Both the electrochemical and thermal properties of Li(Ni$_x$Mn$_y$Co$_z$)O$_2$ are dependent on its composition.
An increase of the Ni content results in an increase in speciﬁc discharge capacity and total residual lithium content, however, the corresponding capacity retention and safety characteristics gradually decreased, Figure \ref{figure_thermal}a. \cite{noh2013comparison} 
Increasing Ni/Mn content leads to lattice thermal conductivity suppression.\cite{yang2020chemical} Thermal conductivity decays exponentially with increasing temperature due to enhanced phonon scattering resulting from the larger thermal population of phonon modes. Figure \ref{figure_thermal} b shows that at room temperature NMC811 has the lowest predicted thermal conductivity of 9.3 \SI{}{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}} , while NMC622 and NMC111 are higher at 13.3 and 17.9 \SI{}{W.m^{-1}.K^{-1}}, respectively. In most devices, the thermal conductivity is much lower than these theoretical upper limit.\cite{takahata2002thermal,chen2006thermal} Both having smaller grain sizes in poly-crystalline cathode materials and charging (delithiation) softens the lattice leading to smaller phonon velocities and stronger phonon scattering. \cite{feng2020quantum,xia2020high} These studies show the accessibility of tuning cathode material properties systematically by optimizing the ratio of the transition metals in NMC alloys, overcoming some of the challenges in battery cathode design.

\section*{Cells: Operation and Degradation}
Atomistic modelling is ideal for investigating bulk and localised behaviour, however, these predictions do not provide macroscopic information on material behaviour at the cell level. 
Here, continuum models are well suited to provide further detail. 
These are governed by mathematical expressions that relate concentrations and potentials (partial differential equations). Values describing different properties, such as diffusion coefficients and equilibrium potentials are required as inputs or parameters.

The DFN model requires over 25 parameters with the exact number dependent on how the equations are expressed.\cite{Kim2011} 
Parameter estimation can be used to simplify the process. The approach requires only voltage and current measurements of the battery to evaluate parameters, removing the need for a cell teardown and extensive characterisation i.e. dismantling the cell to extract the components for analysis. \cite{Jin2018} However, this is complicated by the large number of parameters that have to be fitted.
%\subsection{Pararameterisation (Kieran)}
The computational expense currently precludes the use of this model in battery management systems, instead equivalent circuit models are favoured due to their simplicity.\cite{Marquis2019} However, the DFN model has been used extensively in battery material development as it provides detailed physical insights compared to other model classes.\cite{Dawson2018}

Recent interest in Ni-rich cathodes has seen the DFN model used extensively to understand the use of graded electrodes (containing multiple electrode particle sizes), to deconvolute capacity and power fade predictions, and to investigate the efficacy of tab and electrode designs for fast charging.\cite{Richardson2020,Kindermann2017,Sturm2019} 
This research has been dependent on parameter sets for NMC materials being reported, however, these values may not reliably describe the properties of Ni-rich NMC because studies may use parameters determined for cathodes with lower/unknown Ni content. 
For example, \citeauthor{Richardson2020} et al. modelled an NMC material using the properties of LiNi$_{0.4}$Co$_{0.6}$O$_2$, directly measured by \citeauthor{Ecker2015}\cite{Richardson2020,Ecker2015} \citeauthor{Kindermann2017} measured the geometry of an NMC\textendash with unknown stoichiometry  \textendash electrode extracted from a Samsung cell.\cite{Kindermann2017} 
Electrode diffusivity and reaction rates were estimated and not evaluated directly, while the equilibrium potential was represented by that of an NMC111 material reported elsewhere.\cite{Stewart_2008} 
%In this section, we report the significance of parameterisation in model development and how these developments contribute towards widening the applications and improving the performance of Ni-rich NMC cathodes, primarily NMC811. Furthermore, we highlight several parameterisation efforts investigating the physico-electrochemical and thermal properties of these materials to gain new insights, also noting the importance of software and repositories that increases accessibility to the required parameters and data sets. 

%\subsubsection{Procedures}
%%Parameterisation methods are developed using a specific chemistry, however, these methods are agnostic i.e. techniques demonstrated on one battery can be applied to many others. The DFN model describes the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of a battery. Evaluating these behaviours requires a suite of experimental techniques. These techniques include imaging, bulk/surface chemical methods, electrochemical characterisation, and electrolyte analysis. \cite{Waldmann2016} It is important to be aware of limitations in reported parameter values, due to the assumptions of techniques and how these values are reported. The latter relates to these values often being reported as constants, despite significant dependency on Li concentration, and that parameters relate to a specific battery comprised of unique materials. Multiple techniques can be used to determine each parameter, the choice of technique influences the reported value as each has shortcomings. Several papers compare the measurements of tortuosity, composition, open-circuit voltages, and electrode microstructure using different techniques. \cite{Nguyen2020, Chen2020,Landesfeind2018,Barai2019} These comparisons better illustrate the uncertainty in reported values. However, a technique is often chosen due to the availability of equipment and relevant expertise, rather than because it provides the most robust approach.

%In many modelling experiments, parameters are collated from various literature sources.\cite{Kim2011} This process almost always consists of assumed and/or fitted parameters such as electrode geometry, diffusion coefficients, and activation energies.\cite{Merla2018} 
%The active material and electrodes have purposefully designed compositions and morphologies depending on application, these factors significantly influence the resulting properties.\cite{Lain2019} Simulations using parameters obtained from literature sources prove less accurate because the values do not adequately describe the cell being investigated.\cite{Zhang2014} The parameters measured may be suitable for a specific cell, therefore for different cell chemistries the parameters will have to be reevaluated. 
%For NMC811 the diffusion can vary over orders of magnitude.\cite{Kim2011,noh2013comparison} This difference can be attributed to variations in composition, particle morphology, and electrode geometry.\cite{Liu2008,Luo_2015, Michaelis_2019_understanding} It is not suitable to regard a battery as a "blackbox" with properties being reliably described by literature values, but rather to determine them through tear-down and postmortem characterisation. This process is time consuming and research-intensive, however it provides the most robust approach to provide models with appropriate inputs. 

%\subsubsection{Properties}
Parameterisation is essential for modelling NMC cathode materials, as simulations act as a powerful tool to investigate the properties of NMC and optimise design without the need to conduct resource-intensive experiments.\cite{shearing_2020_3D} 
Previously, several NMC-based (with low nickel content) batteries have been experimentally parameterised. \cite{Ecker2015,Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018,Liebig_2019} \citeauthor{Ecker2015} reported the physico-chemical properties and anatomy of a LiNi$_{0.4}$Co$_{0.6}$O$_2$ based pouch cell, offering a comparison of different techniques used to evaluate the electrode diffusivity. \cite{Ecker2015} \citeauthor{Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018} investigated a battery composed of a NMC111 mapping the exchange current density, its activation energy, and electrode diffusivity as a function of lithiation by defining the stoichiometries of each electrode. \cite{Schmalstieg_Rahe_Ecker_Sauer_2018} \citeauthor{Liebig_2019} studied the electrochemical behaviour of a large format NMC cell, extending the model predictions to include thermal behaviour. \cite{Liebig_2019}  These papers outline parameter sets that can be used in simulations and the methods used to determine them. These methodologies prove a valuable tool for other groups to undertake similar investigations, by detailing a procedure that can be applied to other materials. For modellers investigating high-Ni NMC materials these properties provide limited utility as they do not accurately describe its behaviour. This can be attributed to the electrochemical properties being significantly affected by the different crystal structures in NMC materials.\cite{noh2013comparison} 

It is difficult to predict the values of parameters for high-Ni materials based on the determined values for lower Ni-content materials.\cite{Amin_Chiang_2016} This is attributed to the presence of different thermodynamic phases compared to NMC811, which affects the dependency of several parameters on the state of lithiation.The H2 $\rightarrow$ H3 phase transition above 4.1V has not been reported in NMCs with Ni-contents \textless80\% and can explain parameter differences.\cite{jung2017oxygen} Thermodynamic phases in materials are  property-determinant. To address the limited contributions in this context, authors have focused on specifically parameterising NMC811 chemistries. \citeauthor{Chen2020} detailed the parameters for a 21700-cylindrical cell, validating and tuning these values for cell discharge.\cite{Chen2020}  Sturm \& Jossen \textit{et al.} reported a full electrochemical-parameterisation of a DFN model to study lithium plating during fast charging of a NMC-811/SiC cell. \cite{Sturm2019b,Sturm2019} It can be time consuming to conduct literature searches to find parameters, to develop the code to simulate battery behaviour, and to collect the data to validate model predictions. The availability of software and data has been essential in enabling innovations in this field.

%\subsubsection{Packages}
Traditionally, the sourcing of parameters required an extensive literature search and/or knowledge of prominent authors in the field. Recently, the development of databases and software that collate parameter values for battery components have streamlined this process and proved essential in modelling applications. \cite{Tranter2020,Tranter_2020b} Wang et al. created a database that details over 100 parameterisations of batteries or the individual components and the techniques that have been used to determine them. Additionally, Python Battery Mathematical Modelling (PyBaMM) is a software package that has been explicitly developed for continuum modelling, it caters for multiple definitions and allows the construction of a battery from various component chemistries.\cite{Sulzer_2020} These include parameters that describe a commercially-made NMC811 electrode.\cite{Chen2020} The parameter set for this material has been utilised in several investigations.\cite{Tranter2020,Tranter_2020b} PyBaMM provides a robust approach to modelling of NMC—and other materials—as the electrochemical behaviour can be simulated with only several lines of code (Figure \ref{fig:pybamm}).

Model predictions require validation with experimental data. The validation requirements often call for long-term cycling experiments that many institutions do not have the facilities to carry out themselves. Providing these data sets via open access repositories means researchers can more readily find the data they require for model development.  Data availability in science is critical for progress, this is especially true in model development, providing parameter values and raw data improves accessibility and transparency leading to better research throughout the community. There are many instances of validation data, we would like to highlight the following. \citeauthor{Chen2020} have made available data on the discharge and subsequent relaxation of the NMC811-based cylindrical cell that was used in the validation of the parameter set (Ref. \citenum{zenodo}). \cite{Chen2020} \citeauthor{Devie_2018} have provided datasets on the degradation of 18650 cylindrical cells based on NMC, NCA, and LFP chemistries, the study is ongoing and is examining the influence of operating conditions on the ageing of cells (Ref. \citenum{BatteryArchive}). \cite{Devie_2018}

%\subsubsection{Summary}
Parameterisations are a critical exercise in model development, additionally they provide useful insights into the properties of a lithium-ion battery and its components. It is important to be aware of the nuances in reported parameter values, specifically that different techniques provide considerably different information and that modelling predictions are most accurate when the parameters have been explicitly determined for the battery being studied. The availability of parameters and validation data has proven valuable to the research community, software has been developed in this context. For example, PyBaMM has is a powerful tool that connects researchers with parameter sets and robust code.  

The thermal and electrochemical behaviours of battery materials have been widely described, however, being able to accurately predict the degradation has proven more difficult. 
This can be ascribed to the difficulty measuring the required parameters, presently, many of these parameters are assumed or fitted. 

%\subsection{Degradation: Identifying and Predicting (Anisha and Abir)}

%\subsubsection{Introduction}
%High energy dense cathode materials have intrinsic limitations that lead to degradation, this is accelerated by fast charging.\cite{Xia2018} These processes need to be understood to build  models that can accurately predict lifetime, as well as developing these materials to meet performance requirements.\cite{Hendricks2015} NMC is a three component cathode material that combines the merits of three transition metals; the high capacity from nickel, the thermal stability from manganese, and stable electrochemical characteristics provided from cobalt. Each of these cations and their chemistries contribute differently to the performance of a battery and to the degradation mechanisms.\cite{Julien2014} The steady increase in the Ni content has resulted in different generations of NMC material, ranging from stoichiometries of NMC111 to NMC811, all of which increasing in capacity.\cite{Sari2019} However, a disadvantage of moving towards higher nickel content is the increase in parasitic reactions that accelerates  degradation, such as active material degradation or dissolution, phase transition, oxygen release, and cation mixing.\cite{Dixit2017} Accurately predicting behaviour improves management of batteries to mitigate early aging and avoid accelerating degradation. This requires understanding of the process taking place and characterisation of physical and chemical processes taking place to feed into models.   

%\subsubsection{Mechanisms}
%Cathode materials undergo two key degradation modes: loss of lithium inventory (LLI) and loss of active material (LAM), which are consequences of a range of physical and chemical mechanisms that occur during operation under a range of conditions and negatively impacts the cells impedance, power and capacity.\cite{erickson2017recent,erickson2017recent} 

%Repeated charge-discharge cycling results in substantial structural and volume changes within the electrode material when lithiation and delithiation takes place, resulting in resulting in mechanical degradation, such as particle cracking \cite{Woodford2010} and loss of contact between particles and current collector.\cite{erickson2017recent} Furthermore, the newly formed cracks become filled by electrolyte, increasing the active surface area and charge transfer kinetics which leads to further uncontrolled side reactions with electrolyte that increase cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) passive layer formation and LLI.\cite{erickson2017recent}

%Operating at high voltages(3.8V - 4.3V) results in NMC structures becoming thermodynamically unstable, leading to oxidation of electrolyte at the NMC surface interface and CEI formation, resulting in an increase in impedance due to the consumption of Li ions and diffusivity of Li ions through the passivation layer.\cite{jung2017oxygen,jung2017chemical,jung2018temperature,lin2014surface} Due to its higher nickel content, NMC811 has a higher susceptibility towards oxygen evolution.\cite{Phillip2020} In the delithiated state, phase changes within crystal structure result in the release of oxygen, which goes on to react with the electrolyte and results in the formation of other gaseous products such as carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or other side reactions.\cite{Xiong2017} The amount of O$_2$ release is largest in the first cycle and decreases in the subsequent cycles. \cite{jung2017oxygen}

%Dissolution of transition metals (TM) Ni, Mn and Co takes place via several chemical processes and is exacerbated by long term cycling, high voltages and high temperatures, resulting in LAM and significant capacity fading. \cite{li2018temperature} NMC811 has a higher susceptibility, again due to the reactivity of highly oxidised nickel cations with the electrolyte, causing decomposition, leading to TM dissolution.\cite{billy2018dissolution} Other sources of TM dissolution is the production of acidic species in organic electrolytes reacts the electrode surface.\cite{Zheng2012} Redeposition of dissolved TMs on the anode or cathode can takes place, inducing further side reactions and result in further electrolyte reduction, impedance growth and LLI.\cite{Zheng2012} Cation mixing, where  Ni$^{2+}$ changes its position within the NMC crystal lattice to the Li$^{+}$ site, impedes Li$^{+}$ diffusion back into the cathode, resulting in a decrease is cell capacity.\cite{Sari2019} 

%Degradation is affected by the operating conditions such as temperature, load current, and state of charge (SoC). Monitoring these processes and the state of health (SoH) of batteries is vital for managing capacity fade and protecting cells from early failure, such as thermal runaway. This requires diagnostics tools. 

%\subsubsection{Experimental Techniques}
%Electrochemical techniques are non-invasive and fast approaches to characterising a cells SoH, providing information on the capacity loss and resistance change, as well as aiding diagnosis of the underlying processes taking place. Using galvanostatic and potentiostatic control, the voltage of a cell and it's total capacity from beginning of life (BoL) to end of life (EoL) can be obtained. Variables that need to monitored are capacity, reversibility, stability and rate capability. These can be obtained by charging a cell at constant current (CC), to a defined voltage limit, then constant voltage (CV), to a current limit, followed by discharge at CC, which is sometimes followed by CV step. The performance of a cell is dependant on temperature, hence measurements are carried out under temperature control, and the reversibility of charge and discharge curves inform on the changes in LLI and LAM.\cite{Birkl2017}

%Thermodynamic process can be monitored with open circuit voltage (OCV) measurements, where the equilibrium voltage of a cell is measured and relates to the batteries SoC, providing information such as phase transitions from Li$^{+}$ intercalation and deintercalation. The OCV of a LIB is affected by aging, and therefore used for diagnosis of SoH. Pseudo-OCV tests can also be used and are the same as capacity experiments but where the current rate is slow enough (e.g. from C/20 to C/33) in order to minimise kinetic contributions, electrode polarisation and ohmic heat generation, allowing thermodynamic processes dominate.\cite{Bloom2005} Advanced electrochemical analysis of pseudo-OCV data for differential voltage (DV) and incremental capacity (IC) plots, allows rich information about the cell chemistry to be extracted, such as phase transitions and redox processes taking place in the cathode as well as LLI.\cite{Bloom2005} Processes which are dominating, fading, becoming more resistive or unaffected by repeated cycling are elucidated, which are used for developing degradation models that can accurately predict degradation modes and the effect it has on the health of the cell.\cite{Barai2019}  It should be noted that when using pseudo-OCV for modelling, the charge and discharge hysteresis needs to be taken into consideration.\cite{Garcia-Plaza2017}

%Another common approach to obtaining OCV is using GITT, which involves a series of current pulses and relaxation steps, but is a longer more complex process than the first two approaches.\cite{Dees2009} The technique is based on several underlying assumptions, which should be verified in order to confirm applicability.\cite{Dees2009} During the relaxation step, the Li ion distribution in the electrode homogenises and is dependent on the cell temperature. Lithium ion diffusion coefficients can be extracted from test using models such as the pseudo-2D model proposed by Doyle, Fuller, and Newman. \cite{Doyle1993DFN} This approach avoids kinetic contributions and considered to be most reliable for obtaining OCV data, however it requires long relaxation periods, at least four hours, between steps meaning tests take several weeks to complete. In contrast, pseudo-OCV is more practical to carry out than GITT test and has the added benefit of DV and IC characterisation. Both extract thermodynamic information on transition metals of the cathode and anode undergoing lithiation and delithiation.

%Internal resistance is another key parameter for various cell models, there are several methods of obtaining this. The most employed approach to measuring a cells impedance and diffusion coefficients is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The technique is based measuring the response of a cell to a small AC sinusoidal voltage or current, resulting in amplitude and phase shift of the cells response is measured across a frequency range. The dependency of EIS on SOC or temperature is usually characterised.\cite{Andre2011} The resulting EIS data is most commonly analysed using the Nyquist plot, composed of the real part the impedance on the x-axis and the imaginary on the y-axis, sections of this plot is related to different parts or processes inside the cell and the shape of the Nyquist plot is representative of the electrochemical processes at the surface of the electrodes, such as the solid electrolyte interface, processes in the bulk of the electrolyte, such as lithium ion diffusion, as well as LAM, and phase or structural changes within material.\cite{Jalkanen2015, Andre2011} 
%In the Bode plot, the phase shift is related to the electrochemical and transport processes, which is not evident from the Nyquist plot. Mathematical models based on kinetic and transport equations, e.g. equivalent circuits, are used for interpreting data and require estimates of parameters, therefore often challenging and ambiguous. EIS tends to be carried out alongside other techniques for a more comprehensive investigation, for example, with GITT, or periodically within capacity fade experiments, followed by invasive material characterisation. \cite{Jalkanen2015}

%Pulse techniques are widely adopted approaches for monitoring impedance. One common approach is Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC), which involves the measurement of voltage drop due to a series of charge-discharge pulses with long relaxation periods between. The advantage of this approach is that it provides dynamic power capability of cells as well as an estimate of a cells resistance at a given temperature, SoC and ageing state.\cite{Barai2019} Therefore, have been found useful for validating performance models.\cite{Andre2011}

%Physical and chemical information is obtained from complementary characterisation, are generally invasive but, nonetheless, required for  understanding degradation mechanisms taking place during a cells life cycle and provide further parameters to support the development and validation of realistic ageing models for improved accuracy. This type of characterisation is generally destructive, requiring teardown of cells at various points during cycle ageing for analysis. Microscopy techniques, such as optical, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, are used to characterise the structural changes e.g. porosity, particle size and cracking. X-ray and spectroscopic techniques are used to access chemical composition, including lithiation of NMC particles and the CEI layer.\cite{Waldmann2016} Some in situ techniques have been successfully demonstrated to reveal important microstructural and chemical information, for example, X-ray diffraction computed tomography was carried out on a full cell during operation to study the crystal dimension changes in NMC material.\cite{Sohrab2020} The use of multiple techniques to characterise NMC cells produce the most comprehensive analysis. For example, Dahn et al investigated the effect of high voltage on cycling performance at voltage using microscopy, ex situ and in situ X-ray characterisation, as well as calorimetry to supplement electrochemical data. The group found a dramatic change in active material at high voltages as well as parasitic reactions between the electrolyte and the highly delithiated NMC811 to be the cause of failure at potentials above 4.2V.\cite{Li2015} 

%The chosen experimental/analytical approach significantly influences the obtained information, for model development it is critical to be aware of this variability and whether the technique is applicable to the system being studied. These techniques can be used to quantify the degradation processes to aid modelling.

%\subsubsection{Prediction (Abir)}
%Continuum-scale modelling such as SPM \cite{reniers2019review,jana2019physical} and DFN models \cite{lin2013comprehensive} of positive electrode degradation is an ongoing area of research. The chemical and mechanical degradation processes the NMC electrode material undergoes has been introduced. The parasitic degradation processes TM dissolution, CEI, and oxygen evolution, introduced above, are important features of chemical degradation in NMC. However, very few studies deal with the mechanisms individually. Attempts have been made to model the above-mentioned degradations mechanisms.

%\textit{(i) Surface layer formation and oxygen evolution:} Oxygen evolution from the positive electrode have been conventionally modelled as oxidation of electrolytes at the positive electrode side using a simple kinetically limited Tafel equation. Description of this kind of model has been proposed recently in a few modelling literature of combined degradation study of Li-ion batteries. \cite{lin2013comprehensive,reniers2019review} \citeauthor{jana2019physical} proposed that the capacity fade is a linear function of the oxidation current density, which they used in the Tafel equation to model the electrolyte oxidation at the positive electrode. \cite{jana2019physical} This oxidation reaction also produces \ce{H2} which in turn enhances the transition metal (TM) dissolution. However, theoretical understanding and modelling for the source of the oxygen evolution and its effect on the capacity fade are yet lacking. In this regard, very recently, \citeauthor{ghosh2020shrinking} have proposed a physics-based thermally coupled continuum-scale degradation model for a battery cell containing a high-nickel NMC positive electrode, in which lattice oxygen, [O], release is considered due to the phase transition of the PE materials at higher SoCs. \cite{ghosh2020shrinking} The loss of active material and loss of lithium inventory caused by the formation of a disordered surface layer, such as spinel or rock-salt structure is included. The effect of oxygen evolution and diffusion through the surface layer is also included. They have shown that these mechanisms are sufficient to predict capacity and power fade of the cell with cycling. The model predicts two limiting cases, `diffusion dominated' degradation when [O]-diffusion is slow and/or the passivation layer is thick, and `reaction dominated' degradation if [O]-diffusion is fast and/or if the passivation layer is thin. As the shell thickens, corresponding to a more degraded cell, the capacity fade becomes more `diffusion limited'.

%\textit{(ii) TM Dissolution and CEI formation:} TM dissolution at the positive electrode is modelled using a first order chemical reaction, limited by the concentration of \ce{H+} ions in the electrolyte. \cite{dai2012capacity} \ce{H+} ions are generated from \ce{LiPF6} salt dissociation in the electrolyte and solvent oxidation at the positive electrode. While \ce{LiPF6} dissociation in the presence of \ce{H2O} is modelled using a chemical reaction rate, solvent oxidation is modelled using irreversible Butler-Volmer kinetics. \cite{dai2012capacity} \citeauthor{lin2013comprehensive} provided detailed DFN model equations for TM dissolution at the PE coupled with SEI layer formation at NE. \cite{lin2013comprehensive} The TM deposition on NE is also included in the model. The growth of the CEI can be modelled as similar to any of the SEI layer growth models. 

%\subsubsection{Summary}
%Key degradation processes that take place at the cathode material and their effects have been discussed, as well as fundamental characterisation techniques that aide tracking and monitoring of these processes have been introduced. In order to use models to estimate aging mechanisms during normal or even fast charging, accurate determination of the parameters that describe the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the cell is key. The reliability of models to predict a cells behaviour, which varies between different types of cells, requires experimental data. Electrochemical techniques are fast and practical diagnostic tools used in situ characterisation of battery performance, providing information on capacity, resistance and coulombic efficiency. The use of multiple approaches produces rich data, which is required for cell monitoring, deciphering the degradation processes taking place during cell cycling, and essential for accurate parameterisation and validation of models, leading towards the design of more realistic models for accurate prediction of cells life.

Progress has also been made in using machine learning to develop new, more reliable, potentials. \citeauthor{deringer2019machine} recently published a progress update, showing how machine learning is improving interatomic potentials by ``learning'' from electronic-structure data, which give better accuracy in approximating material properties. \cite{deringer2019machine}

Inaccuracies in continuum models have manifested due to the lack of original parameter sets in literature and improper experimental design. Realistic models for predicting cell lifetime and managing operation require a comprehensive understanding of the degradation processes. To obtain representative data, physical and chemical characterisation needs to be carried out. The use of multiple diagnostic tools produces rich data, essential for accurate parameterisation and validation of models, leading towards the design of more realistic models for accurate prediction of cells life. However, information in literature may not be representative of the material being modelled and mistakes can be easily propagated.\cite{Howey_2020} Extensive parameterisation of high Ni content NMC stoichiometries is needed to avoid use of data from lower Ni materials, which are not suitably representative due to dissimilar properties. Further to this, construction of a parameter database would prevent reproduction of errors. Equally important is having a holistic understanding of the experimental techniques and model assumptions. The theory underpinning the experiments used in parameterisation must be consistent with that of the model to make truly robust predictions. There are several research groups around the world currently working towards addressing these problems.


Continuum models of high-nickel electrode degradation are key to reveal the underlying physics of the degradation mechanisms. At the same point of time, whole-cell Li-ion battery models are incomplete without the incorporation of positive electrode degradation mechanisms. In that respect, modelling of individual degradation mechanisms as well as combining them into the whole-cell models is the future goal. Accurate parameterisation is important for the success of these kind of models. Degradation experiments and fundamental molecular-scale and DFT studies are essential for the development of continuum scale whole-cell degradation models.\cite{Sulzer_2020} These models will then be capable of predicting the key conditions to increase the life-time of these batteries.

Connecting continuum and atomistic models predictions can provide a more detailed understanding of the charge and mass transport processes, resulting in more accurate predictions of battery behaviour. Attempts to join the atomistic to the continuum scale have been previously attempted, however, there is no simplistic method for joining the different length scales due to the difference in mathematical principles used in each model.\cite{Fackeldey2015} Continuum models comprise of partial differential equations (PDEs), while atomistic models use discrete models.\cite{Badia2007} This difference in mathematical principles leads to different calculable properties, for example, in atomistic modelling charge transport is related to self-diffusion within the crystal lattice, whereas charge transport in continuum modelling relates to macroscopic diffusion in the electrode, often being experimentally determined. Solutions to overcome this mismatch in calculable properties is of great interest and one of the biggest challenges in obtaining consistent multi-scale models of battery materials.
